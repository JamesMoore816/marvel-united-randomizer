# Marvel United Randomizer

### Deployed version can be accessed here: united-randomizer.netlify.app

This is a randomizer app for the board game Marvel United, built in Javascript and React. It is a work-in-progress, so some assets are missing and some features are not yet available.

FEATURE UPDATES ARE ON HOLD UNTIL THE NEW RULEBOOKS ARE RELEASED IN MID-APRIL, 2022.

Users can select game options, as well as what sets/expansions and individual pieces they want to include in their initial set up, and the randomizer returns a random set up accounting for those options.
